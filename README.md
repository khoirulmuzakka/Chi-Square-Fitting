# Chi-Square-Fitting
Python codes for my global analysis simulations with artificial data

In this talk, I demonstrate the importance of including data correlation in a chi-square fit. I also explain the interpretation of correlated chi-square and the validity of Hessian error method. If the data sets have some tensions between each other, its effect on the fit is also demonstrated in the simulation.
